Title: Log-Ratio Biplots for Compositional Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Zhilong Zhang
Maintainer: Zhilong Zhang <zhilongz@tamu.edu>
Description: The compBiplot package provides tools for creating log-ratio biplots 
    of compositional data. Compositional data, where variables represent proportions 
    or parts of a whole, require specialized analysis due to their constant-sum 
    constraint. The package implements core functions for log-ratio transformations 
    (clr, ilr), principal component analysis (PCA) in the simplex, and biplot 
    visualization using covariance or correlation scaling. It offers a unified and 
    user-friendly interface for exploring relationships among components in compositional 
    datasets and visualizing their geometric structure in reduced dimensions.
